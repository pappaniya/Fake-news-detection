# Fake-news-detection
Fake news has become a widespread issue due to the rapid growth of digital media. Misleading information spreads quickly on social networks, influencing public opinion and creating confusion. To address this problem, this project aims to build an AI-based Fake News Detection System using machine learning and natural language processing.
# LIMITATIONS
The dataset used is a bit biased and it causes the project to be biased towards fake news. However using a better dataset can fix the problem of detecting fake news only.It cannot also detect images or videos.
